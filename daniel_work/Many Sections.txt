This is a snippet
print("Hello World")
And this is another little slice of text
for i in range(10)
	print(i)

class Example:
	def __init__():
		print("plz don't judge the content of this code")

	def (self):
		print("instead on it's soul and character")

And what's this? Oh! Yet another snippet of text!
import another_snippet as anotha_snip
many many snippets
while and_another_one:
	if i == 4 and j == 6:
		print("last one promise")
	else:
		print("pinky promise")
